# GIF Finder Application

In this application, select a topic button (or create a new one) to retrieve GIFs from the GIPHY API. Per assignment instructions, GIFs that are returned default to non-animated images; animation will occur upon clicking on the returned image. Each time a topic is clicked, the user will receive new images instead of the same first 10 received upon the initial click.

Each image has its rating displayed at the bottom of the image thumbnail. Images may be favorited upon clicking the icon in the top-right corner; this will relocate the image into the 'favorites' section where the user has the option to unfavorite the GIF. **Through the use of local storage, favorited items will persist even when the user leaves the application.**
